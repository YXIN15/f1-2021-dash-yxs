# Formula 1 2021 Season Team and Driver Performance Summary
## Welcome!
This dashboard is based on the Formula 1 2021 Season data and highlights. A detailed proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/f1-2021-analysis/blob/main/reports/proposal.md).

## Usage
The app opens to a `Teams Summary` page. This page initially displays one table, which shows the ranking of each Forumla 1 team at the end of the 2021 season, along with the total number of points each team earned. <br>
Clicking a radio button beside a name team will display a second table to the right. This table contains information specific to each team, such as their full team name, where their base is located, the number of world championships they have have, and more. <br>
The second page is the `Drivers Summary` page. Initially only a dropdown is displayed, where users can select a driver's name. Once a name has been selected, information specific to that driver will appear below the dropdown. This includes the driver's photo, and a table containing information such as what team the driver is on, the number of points they have earned in the season, the number of podiums and world championships they have earned, their place of birth, and more. To the left of the photo and table, users can see a plot that shows the driver's [Driver Ratings](https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-22/news/f1-22-driver-ratings) information, both from the beginning and the end of the season.
